- name: 'Duck'
  description: ' A feature added for no other reason than to draw management attention and be removed, thus avoiding unnecessary changes in other aspects of the product. This started as a piece of Interplay corporate lore. It was well known that producers (a game industry position, roughly equivalent to PMs) had to make a change to everything that was done. The assumption was that subconsciously they felt that if they didn’t, they weren’t adding value. The artist working on the queen animations for Battle Chess was aware of this tendency, and came up with an innovative solution. He did the animations for the queen the way that he felt would be best, with one addition: he gave the queen a pet duck. He animated this duck through all of the queen’s animations, had it flapping around the corners. He also took great care to make sure that it never overlapped the actual animation. Eventually, it came time for the producer to review the animation set for the queen. The producer sat down and watched all of the animations. When they were done, he turned to the artist and said, That looks great. Just one thing – get rid of the duck.'

We would always phrase our questions as: What if Jimmy forgets to update the attribute?  This led to the term Jimmy-proof when referring to well designed framework code.  It’s probably best not to use this term around IronRuby developer Jimmy Schementi.'

- name: 'Stringly-Typed'
  description: ' A riff on strongly-typed. Used to describe an implementation that needlessly relies on strings when programmer- and refactor-friendly options are available.  Examples:  Method parameters that take strings when other more appropriate types should be used  On the occasion that a string is required in a method call (e.g. network service), the string is then passed and used throughout the rest of the call graph without first converting it to a more suitable internal representation (e.g. parse it and create an enum, then you have strong typing throughout the rest of your codebase)  Message passing without using typed messages etc.  Excessively stringly typed code is usually a pain to understand and detonates at runtime with errors that the compiler would normally find.'
